# A roadmap, of sorts

## Next

+ Create a text file representing the task.

## Soon

+ Read back in the text file
+ Support multiple tasks
+ Invent paths for done, doing.

## Vision

+ Infinitely deep tree. Keep splitting off next actions until you get it down to something you can do.
+ File system backed. Tasks are text files. Hierarchy is represented by paths. All in ~/.task-bard/
